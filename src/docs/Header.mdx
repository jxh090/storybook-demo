# Header

The Header component displays the top navigation bar of your application.  
It typically includes branding, navigation links, and user authentication actions such as login, logout, and account creation.

Use the Header to provide users with consistent access to key navigation and account features across your app.

## Features

- **Branding:** Display your application's logo or name prominently.
- **Navigation:** Provide links to key sections of your application.
- **User Actions:** Include buttons or menus for login, logout, and account creation.
- **Responsiveness:** Adapts to different screen sizes for mobile and desktop users.
- **Accessibility:** Designed to be accessible for all users, including keyboard and screen reader support.

## Usage

To use the Header component, import it and include it at the top of your application's layout.  
You can customize the navigation links and user actions by passing the appropriate props.

```jsx
import { Header } from './Header';

<Header
  user={user}
  onLogin={handleLogin}
  onLogout={handleLogout}
  onCreateAccount={handleCreateAccount}
/>
```

## Props

| Name            | Type     | Description                                      |
|-----------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `user`          | object   | The current user object, or `null` if not logged in. |
| `onLogin`       | function | Callback for when the user clicks the login button. |
| `onLogout`      | function | Callback for when the user clicks the logout button. |
| `onCreateAccount` | function | Callback for when the user clicks the create account button. |

## Customization

You can customize the Header by providing your own branding, navigation links, or user menu.  
For advanced customization, consider extending the Header component or using composition.

### Example: Custom Navigation

```jsx
<Header
  user={user}
  onLogin={handleLogin}
  onLogout={handleLogout}
  onCreateAccount={handleCreateAccount}
  navLinks={[
    { label: 'Home', href: '/' },
    { label: 'About', href: '/about' },
    { label: 'Contact', href: '/contact' },
  ]}
/>
```

## Best Practices

- Keep navigation simple and intuitive.
- Ensure the Header is visible and accessible on all pages.
- Use clear labels for navigation and user actions.
- Test the Header on different devices and screen sizes.

## Examples

Below are examples of the Header component in different states:

### Logged In

<Canvas of={HeaderStories.LoggedIn} />

### Logged Out

<Canvas of={HeaderStories.LoggedOut} />

## Related Components

- **Sidebar:** For additional navigation options.
- **Footer:** For secondary navigation and information.
- **UserMenu:** For user-specific actions and settings.

## Troubleshooting

- If the Header does not appear, ensure it is imported and rendered in your layout.
- Check that all required props are provided.
- Review the browser console for any errors or warnings.
