# Storybook Documentation Demo

Welcome to the **Storybook Demo**!  
This page demonstrates how you can edit documentation directly through GitHub's web editor.

## How to Edit

1. Navigate to this file in your [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jxh090/storybook-demo):  
   `/src/docs/Introduction.stories.mdx`
2. Click the **pencil icon** (✏️) in the top right to edit the file.
3. Make your changes using Markdown and MDX.  
   Need help converting plain text to MDX? Try an online tool like [Text to MDX](https://www.text2mdx.com/).
4. Commit your changes and create a pull request if needed.

> **Tip:** You can preview your documentation changes in Github after editing.

## Why Use GitHub's Web Editor?

- No need to clone the repo locally.
- Quick updates to documentation.
- Collaborate easily with your team.

Happy documenting!
