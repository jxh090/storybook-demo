# Storybook Documentation Demo

**DISCLAIMER:** This a WIP and this demonstration’s purpose is largely to understand the workflow for a non-developer to update/add documentation.

Welcome to the **Storybook Demo**!  
The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate how you can edit documentation directly through GitHub's web editor and see the results in the [storybook preview](https://jxh090.github.io/storybook-demo/?path=/docs/introduction--documentation).

## How to Edit

1. Navigate to your relevant file in the GitHub repository:  
   `/src/docs/<file>.stories.mdx`
2. Click the **pencil icon** (✏️) in the top right to edit the file.
3. Make your changes using Markdown and MDX.  
   Need help converting plain text to MDX? Try an online tool like [Text to MDX](https://www.text2mdx.com/).
4. Commit your changes and create a pull request if needed.

> **Tip:** You can preview your documentation changes in Storybook after editing.

## Why Use GitHub's Web Editor?

- No need to clone the repo locally.
- Quick updates to documentation.
- Collaborate easily with your team.

Happy documenting!
